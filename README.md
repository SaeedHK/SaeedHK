# Hi there, I'm Saeed 👋

## 🧮 Applied Mathematician × Software Engineer

I bring a blend of mathematical thinking and practical software engineering to solve complex problems. With a PhD in Applied Mathematics, plus 6+ years building production systems, I bridge the gap between theory and implementation.

### 🏆 Mathematical Background
- **Silver Medal** at International Mathematical Olympiads (2007)
- **PhD in Applied Mathematics** from PSL (Paris Dauphine) - Thesis on Learning in Mean Field Games
- **4 publications** in top-tier applied mathematics journals, cited by DeepMind research teams
- **Postdoctoral Research** at École Polytechnique on modeling congestion in energy markets

### 💻 Engineering Expertise
I've spent the last 6+ years building scalable data infrastructure and SaaS applications:

- **Data Engineering**: Designed ETL pipelines with Apache Airflow, AWS Lambda, and Kubernetes
- **Cloud Architecture**: 5+ years working with AWS (Lambda, SQS, S3, EC2, SageMaker, ECS)
- **Backend Development**: Full-stack experience with Django, Ruby on Rails, Symfony, FastAPI
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring with Datadog and Grafana

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages**: Python • TypeScript • SQL  
**Frameworks**: Django • Ruby on Rails • Symfony • FastAPI • Next.js • React.js  
**Cloud & Infra**: AWS • Docker • Kubernetes • Airflow  
**Tools**: Jenkins • GitHub Actions • Datadog • Grafana • Vim • Git

### 🚀 Featured Project
#### [airflow-k8s](https://github.com/SaeedHK/airflow-k8s)
A production-grade GIS data pipeline prototype showcasing modern data engineering practices:
- Apache Airflow on Kubernetes with KubernetesExecutor
- Dynamic task mapping for parallel processing of satellite thermal imagery
- Field-level temperature computation using polygon masking with shapely and rasterio
- Complete observability stack with Grafana and Loki
- Clean architecture with Pydantic models, type safety, and comprehensive testing
- Developer-friendly local setup with Minikube and hot-reloading

Built with: Python • Apache Airflow • Kubernetes • Helm • Docker • AWS S3 • Grafana
